   Quotes by Chief Seattle:
  </h3>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     “All things share the same breath - the beast, the tree, the man. The air shares its spirit with all the life it supports.”
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     “Take nothing but memories, leave nothing but footprints!”
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     “Earth does not belong to us; we belong to earth.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     “What is man without the beasts? If all the beasts were gone, man would die from a great loneliness of spirit. For whatever happens to the beasts, soon happens to man. All things are connected.”
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     “There is no quiet place in the white man’s cities, no place to hear the leaves of spring or the rustle of insects’ wings. Perhaps it is because I am a savage and do not understand, but the clatter only seems to insult the ears.”
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     “Whatever befalls the earth, befalls the sons of the earth. If men spit upon the ground, they spit upon themselves.”
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     “Humankind has not woven the web of life. We are but one thread within it. Whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves. All things are bound together. All things connect.”
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     “Humans merely share the earth. We can only protect the land, not own it.”
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
